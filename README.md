## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @Demerak

I am an undergraduate student studying toward the Bachelor of Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering and the Bachelor of Science in Computing Technology (COOP). I am currently in my fifth year pursuing this BASc and I have finally completed all the courses required to graduate in Mechanical Engineering. I'm now pursuing my studies part-time to complete the remaining computing technology classes.
