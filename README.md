## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @Demerak

I am an undergraduate student studying toward the Bachelor of Applied Science in Mechanical Engineering and the Bachelor of Science in Computing Technology (COOP). I am currently in my fifth year pursuing this BASc and I have finally completed all the courses required to graduate in Mechanical Engineering. I'm now pursuing my studies part-time to complete the remaining computing technology classes.

## What I'm working on
I started this section in 2022. Here's what I have done since then. Once I'm done with something, I move it into the archive section. 

### Things I'm working on right now :writing_hand:

* ```System.out.println("Learning Java")```
* Refining my Python skills following this Data Analyst with Python course [datacamp website](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-with-python). 
* Playing around with my raspberry pi
* Learning JavaScript (on pause right now, see [learning folder](https://github.com/Demerak/Learning))


### Things I've worked on and are completed (Archived) :green_book:
#### Personal Project
* TicTacToe Game made using Java with GUI interface 
* Python Bot on my Discord Server run on one of my raspberry pis
* I made a multitude of Python Scrapper (Amazon, Instagram, NYBits, and more). I used libraries like beautiful soup and selenium to do them. 
* Setup a smart mirror using [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)
* Create a website using JavaScript ([my website](https://demerak.github.io/alex-app/))
* TODO

#### Work-Related Project
* I developed data extraction tools using Python to automate manual reporting tasks, saving days' worth of efforts recurrently and providing data previously inaccessible. 
  * Created a user-friendly web tool to allow non-technical users to effectively access and work with system data. It's a web app that I made using Django to allow other employees to use my reporting tool. 
* Developed a standalone reporting tool to automatically track changes to parcel sorter machine settings that are difficult and time-consuming to monitor manually.
