## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @Demerak

I graduated with a BASc in Mechanical Engineering and a BSc in Computing Technology from the University of Ottawa. While initially focused on Mechanical Engineering, my growing passion for software led me to pursue a double major. I completed Mechanical Engineering requirements in 2021 and continued part-time to achieve the Computing Technology BSc, which I completed in 2023.
