## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @Demerak

I graduated with a BASc in Mechanical Engineering and a BSc in Computing Technology from the University of Ottawa. While initially focused on Mechanical Engineering, my growing passion for software led me to pursue a double major. I completed Mechanical Engineering requirements in 2021 and continued part-time to achieve the Computing Technology BSc, which I completed in 2023.

[Here's my website.]()  ðŸš§ I'm currently working on updating my portfolio. 

## What I'm working on
I started this section in 2022. Here's what I have done since then. Once I'm done with a project, I'll move it into the archive section. 

### Things I'm working on right now :writing_hand:

* I am working on a desktop application for my relatives to allow them to edit PDFs for free [Private Desktop Application PDF Editor](https://github.com/Demerak/desktop-private-pdf-editor)
* Currently developing a dashboard to visualize real-time vehicle data accessed via the OBD2 port [dashboard](https://github.com/Demerak/car-dashboard)
  * Expanding expertise in real-time data through exploration of technologies such as Kafka, Websocket, and io socket
* Always exploring new resources to enhance data visualization in Python or Javascript
* Working on a personal finance portfolio; the front end is built using React, and the backend is developed with Express
* Creating a new portfolio website using Nextjs
  * I'm currently spending some time improving my design skills using Figma


### Things I've worked on and are completed (Archived) :green_book:
#### Personal Project

##### Java
* TicTacToe game made using Java with GUI interface ([TicTacToe Game](https://github.com/Demerak/TicTacToeGUI))
* Snake game with GUI interface ([Snake Game](https://github.com/Demerak/SnakeGame))

##### Python
* Python Bot on my Discord Server runs on one of my Raspberry Pi
* I made a multitude of Python scrappers (Amazon, Instagram, NYBits, and more). I used libraries like Beautiful Soup and Selenium to do them. 

##### JavaScript & Web Dev
* Create a website using JavaScript ([my website](https://demerak.github.io/alex-app/)) ðŸš§ This is actually my first attempt at a portfolio website
* Learning JavaScript (on pause right now, see [learning folder](https://github.com/Demerak/Learning))

#### Other
* Learning mobile app development using Android Studio
* Refining my Python skills following this Data Analyst with Python course [datacamp website](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-with-python)
* I'm starting to learn about 3D (LWJGL) and 2D graphics programming, see my [latest 2D project](https://github.com/Demerak/2DGame)


##### Hardware, Linux, Cloud :cloud: & Ethical Hacking
* Setup a smart mirror using [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)
* Setup a Kasm workspace which streams to my device isolated instance of pretty much anything using Docker containers, and set up a VM on Azure (ubuntu) [see NetworkChuck Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7e-mcJdZok). In his tutorial he used Linode but I decided to use Azure since I have a student subscription. When using Azure, you need to add a new Inbound port rule to allow HTTPS connection, it won't work otherwise. 

#### Work-Related Project
*	Leading data insight efforts to support the deployment of a new plant, I extract data and store it locally in a DuckDB database to enable local analysis. I then translate these insights into actionable recommendations.
*	Developed a React-based dashboard, supported by an Express.js backend, to effectively present our data, including previously inaccessible competitor analysis data, in an easy-to-understand format. This facilitated targeted regional improvements, strengthening our position and market share.
* I developed data extraction tools using Python to automate manual reporting tasks, recurrently saving days' worth of effort and providing previously inaccessible data. 
  * Created a user-friendly web tool to allow non-technical users to effectively access and work with system data. It's a web app that I made using Django to allow other employees to use my reporting tool. 
* Developed a standalone reporting tool to automatically track changes to parcel sorter machine settings that are difficult and time-consuming to monitor manually.
